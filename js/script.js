	"A tall, well-dressed woman sits in the parlor of 221 B Baker Street. She wrings an intricately embroidered hankercheif in her hands, betraying her otherwise calm demeanor. \"I beg of you to help me,\" she states in a serious tone.  Watson pours brandy into a crystal glass on the mantle. \"Mrs Forrest, if you would please start at the beginning\". The woman accepts a glass and downs the amber liquid in a single shot, crinkling her nose in distaste. \"You must understand, my Jeremy simply does not have the constitution for murder. Not to mention, he was not acquianted with this woman doctor, this May Quinna\". Watson takes a seat by the fire. \"Why was he staying at the Hotel Grand?\" \"I cannot say, he was supposed to be in Johannesberg visiting his sick mother.\" A knock on the door, and Inspector Lestrade enters the room. \"You asked to see me?\" Watson rises to greet the detective, \"Yes, inspector. I hear you have arrested Jeremy Forrest for the murder of Doctor May Quinna?\" Lestrade huffs, \"Why yes, an open and shut case. The doctor found dead hours before her speech at the conference. A witness reports seeing Mr Forrest leaving the hotel room of the deceased 10 minutes before housekeeping discovered the body. All we have left is to discover how he killed her.\" Suddenly, Sherlock Holmes jumps up, startling the other occupants of the room. \"I am afraid sir, you have arrested an innocent man. Please tell me you interviewed others.\" Lestrade sputters for a minute before recovering his composure. \"Lionel Linquin, the bellboy, delivered room service to Mr. Forrest. Then there was Shana Shen, the housekeeper, who found the doctors body. Oh yes, and Damien Folmett, the guest in the ajoining room.\" Prove Jeremy\'s innocence and discover a) the murderer b) the motive and c) the murder weapon.",
	"Watson and Holmes are enjoying an afternoon reading when a frantic woman bursts through the door, followed closely by a cursing Inspector Lestrade. \"YOU MUST FIND HER!\" The woman sobs, as Lestrade attempts to restrain her. \"Mrs. Partridge! I assure you, Scotland Yard has the best officers on the case. We will find your daughter.\" \"SHE COULD BE DEAD! SHE COULD BE TAKEN BY...\" The woman crumples to the floor mid-scream. \"She seems to have fainted, Holmes,\" Lestrade says, lifting Mrs. Partridge from the floor into a settee. \"Can\'t say I am much surprised.\" Watson remarks. Lestrade pulls out his notes, \"Lisa Partridge, age 6, disappeared from her school group this morning. Eva Manceo, teacher, contacted the girl's mother and the police shortly after 10am. Also escorting the group, Miss Theresa Pernnet and Miss Juliana Goodwin, both teachers at London's Finishing School for Young Ladies. All other students are accounted for. While the child may have wandered off, we are not discounting the possibility of an abduction. Naturally, we've organized searches of the area they were to be visiting - World Aquarium and Buckingham Palace as well as the surrounding buildings and nearby market\" Pacing the room, Holmes gestures wildy, \"Yes, yes, but have you recovered the cat?\" Lestrade stares at Holmes blankly. \"What cat?\" \"The cat owned by the family\" Holmes gestures to the fainted woman. Watson shakes his head and says, \"There was no mention of a cat, Sherlock.\" Holmes stands in frustration \"Of course there was a cat! The white fur on this woman's dress, the long parallel scratches on her hands. This family had a cat. Find the cat, find the child!\" Discover a) the location of Lisa and b) the motive behind her disappearance. ",
	"Sherlock Holmes enters the study of Harrison Smyth, barrister. The man in question lays face-down on the floor surrounded by a pool of blood. Paperwork is scattered across the room. As the residents of the room watch in horror, a breeze from the open window shifts a pile of papers onto the floor. A large desk holds writing implements and a shaving kit. \"Bashed in the head\". Watson says, as he closes the window firmly. \"I need not be a surgeon to see the large dent in his temple.\" Inspector Lestrade rises from his position by the body as two new arrivals enter the room. \"Gentlemen, allow me to introduce - Mary Hamel and Jamir Jones, house keeper and gardener for Mr. Smyth\". Jones moves forward, \"I cannot believe anyone would want to kill Harry. I have been part of this household for 25 years. Harry treated us right, he did. He didn\'t deserve to die,\" He moves to position himself in front of Mary as the latter blanches at the sight of blood. \"Aye,\" Mary croaks, \"He was alone all day, I found \'em loike this about four when \'e didn\'t ring for coffee. Always rings for coffee did \'arry\". Holmes surveys the room intently, \"Is anything missing?\" Both heads shake. Jones explains, \"He kept the door locked most days\". Mary adds, \"The last few weeks he wouldn\'a go out much\". Lestrade ushers the two out of the room and closes the door. \"Harrison Smythe was one half of Smythe & Baryl, the other being Mortimer Baryl. Without a doubt, Baryl is the killer\". Lestrade holds up a photo of a middle aged bearded man, Smythe, and a tall pale man, Baryl. Holmes looks unconvinced. Discover a) the murderer b) the murder weapon and c) the motive.",
	"CONFIDENTIAL - POLICE FILE\nCASE No. 155215\nSUBJECT: MULIPLE HOMICIDE\nINQUIRY: a) Discover the identity of the murderer and b) the motive\nNOTE: This case is not scored on number of clues used.",
	"\"Sherlock Holmes, I humbly ask for your help. The crown princess of Croatia, Zia, has become rebellious – escaping her guards on a regular basis. I fear a diplomatic incident if this behavior does not cease. Please attend to the Hotel Grand tomorrow and ensure her safe passage to Denmark in time for the wedding.\" Sherlock Holmes folds the letter and puts it his pocket, looking around the room disinterested. Watson coughs and steps forward, \"...And that, Princess, is why we are here.\" Across the room, a striking black-haired woman watches as a maid applies dark red varnish to long, maniucured nailes. \"Yes, the council is smothering as always.\". The maid startles and drops the bottle, spilling dark red varnish across the floor. She gasps in horror, \"Mon dieu!-\" Zia cuts off the woman with a wave of her hand, \"Maria, stop. Get up and clean that mess.\" Watson offers a hand to the young woman who graciously accepts, rising to her feet before racing out of the room. \"Well, if you must be here until the carriage arrives, I will introduce my courtiers, Jim and John. I know not their real names.\" The Princess gestures to the men standing near her. Jim, a tall blond man of slight frame, nods. Younger and lanky, he walks with a slight limp. \"Congratuations on your upcoming marriage,\" Watson remarks. Zia examines a large diamond ring on her finger with obvious pleasure. \"Yes. Soon I will be not only Princess of Croatia but also of Denmark\". Sherlock draws Watson aside, \"A scheme is afoot here, Watson.\" What does Sherlock mean? Discover a) what the Princess hiding?",
	"ARSONIST ARRESTED - June 15th, 1898\nScotland Yard announced an arrest in the case of the Whitechapel Arsonist yesterday. Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade was caught at the scene of an abandoned Whitechapel boarding house holding a bag filled with paraffin-soaked rags. Police Constable Murcher declined to comment, saying only \"The investigation is ongoing\". Sources close to Scotland Yard cite that Sherlock Holmes and his ever-present companion John Watson are involved in the investigation.\n\nInspector Lestrade\'s eyes are bloodshot, his face unshaven and grim. \"I cannot speak of it,\" he croaks. \"Well, tell us what you can, then,\"  Watson says. The prisoners's eyes dart back and forth for a few seconds, but he remains silent. Sherlock looks pointedly at Watson, \"As I said, if he truly is commited to confessing, why intervene?\" the sleuth stands and shakes the dust from his coat. \"Come now Watson, let us see to clients who WANT our help\".\n\nDiscover a) Why did Lestrade confess? b) Who is the arsonist? and c) Why did the arsonist set the fires?"

	"Lionel Linquin, the bellboy, recognized Dr Quinna when he carried her suitcases to her hotel room. Lionel Linquin\'s father died during trials of Quinna\'s experimental ebola protocol. Seeing an opportunity for revenge, he poisioned her room service with cynanide. Jeremy Forrest lied to his wife and tracked down the doctor to beg for her help treating his mother, who contracted ebola. The arrest was a result of unfortunate timing. ",
	"Eva Manceo, the biological mother of Lisa, stole the Partridge cat and used the animal to lure her daughter to the aquarium, knowing the hungry cat would follow the scent of fish.",
	"The body found in the study of Harrison Smythe was, in fact, the body of Smythe's cousin Oliver Clark. Clark - a criminal - immigrated from the continent and stole the identity of his cousin, whom he killed and buried in the garden. Clark was beardless and needed to hide from his servants for a few weeks while he grew a beard to more closely resemble his cousin. Jamir Jones, deeply loyal to Smyth, discovered the body in the garden and killed Clark in revenge.",
	"Theresa Bali and Percy Jones cooperated to commit the murders. When the children, members of the Silvers gang, began to demand a share of the criminal profits, Theresa asked Percy to dispose of them. Percy decided to incriminated Jonathan Smart in the murders by leaving Jonathan's fillet knife at the scene of the crime and having Theresa's husband report a witness statement. Percy knew Jonathan was angry at being the victim of the pick-pocket gang and counted on Jonathan to further incriminate himself. The proximity of the bodies to the church was coincidence.",
	"Princess Zia was unhappy with her arranged marriage and switched places with her maid, Maria. The Princess fired her guards so no one would suspect the deception and allow Maria to marry the Prince in her place. While exploring the city enjoying her new freedom, Zia fell in love with a criminal named The Badger. Knowing he was wanted by the police, she was attempting to smuggle the theif into Croatia in the Royal Luggage, which could not be inspected.",
	"Gregory Lestrade confessed because he believed he was guilty. The real arsonist, Calahan O\'Donnel, wanted revenge on Lestrade for sending his brother to prison. Calahan bribed a maid to drug Lestrade's meals, causing the Inspector to have blackouts. Then it was simply a matter of placing Lestrade near the scene of the crime with incriminating evidence on his person. Lestrade put together his frequent blackouts and current situation and assumed he had committed all of the crimes."
