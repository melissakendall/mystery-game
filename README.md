# Mystery Game

A Sherlock Holmes style game based on the board game 221b Baker Street: Master Detective.

The stories, clues and solutions are stored in firebase, although the current version of the application hard-codes the data while I transition from Realtime to Firestore.

This repo was originally created in 2017 in Bit Bucket.
