<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>To begin, all players should open the game on their phones:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collaboratively, the players select a case from the dropdown and read the adventure text. If preferred, one player can be selected to read aloud. This will be the adventure that all players attempt to solve during the game.</p>
<p>The game can be played competitively or cooperatively with any number of players. The following rules describe competitive play.</p>
<p>Each case represents a different adventure. An average game with four players will last around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At the end of each adventure, the items to be solved are listed with letters: a), b), etc. Answer these questions to win the game.</p>
<h3>PLAY</h3>
<p>All players begin simultaneously. The basic procedure of play is to read the next clue in the set and try to answer the questions presented in the case using the clues.</p>
<p>You may wish to use a sheet of paper to take notes. Keep track of the clues you visit, read clues <strong>IN ORDER</strong>.</p>
<p>When done, players put their phones face down on the table. Once all players are complete, the next around begins.</p>
<h3>CLUES</h3>
<p>Each case has a set number of clues, generally organized from least-helpful (lowest number) to most-helpful (highest number). Each of these is listed in the Clues dropdown.</p>
<p>When you select a clue, the text appears in the box.</p>
<h3>TYPES OF CLUES</h3>
<p>There are two basic types of clues, <strong>general clues</strong> and <strong>puzzle clues</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>General clues</strong> give a statement about the case. This can be in the form of useful or not useful information (red herring).</p>
<ul>
<li>Example 1: Anne Gerry is not the murderer</li>
<li>Example 2: John Bell enjoys painting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Puzzle clues</strong> ask you to gather a set of words and determine which other word they sound like. These are usually clues to the motive, killer, etc.</p>
<p>Example: Murderer (2 Parts) I &ndash; A grown up kitten.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motive<strong> &ndash; </strong>Lets you know this clue is to determine the murderer</li>
<li>2 Parts<strong> &ndash; </strong>To determine the answer, you must gather other clues. This is 1 of 2 clues</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2: Murderer (2 Parts) II &ndash; The hard part of a block of cheese - D</p>
<p>Using the two clues above: CAT + RIN</p>
<p>If there was a character in the case named Catherine, you know she is the murderer.</p>
<h3>WINNING THE GAME</h3>
<p>When you think you have solved the case, you must announce &ldquo;Eurkea!&rdquo; to indicate to others to pause play. Then press the Solve! Button on the app and see if you were correct. If not, you are out of the game and play continues. Otherwise, you win!</p>
<p>To win, you must give the correct answer to all lettered items. For example, a) killer, b) weapon, and c) motive.</p>
<p>When checking your answers, you do not have to give the exact answers listed. For example, if the motive listed in is "Inheritance," and you say "She wanted the money" that&rsquo;s acceptable. But if you say the motive was "Blackmail," that is wrong.</p>
